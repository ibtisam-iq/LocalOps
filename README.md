# LocalOps  

**LocalOps** is a hands-on repository dedicated to exploring, understanding, and demonstrating pre-containerization workflows for multi-tier applications. It features my work with **2-tier** and **3-tier** applications in major programming languages like **Java**, **Python**, **.NET**, and **JavaScript**, showcasing how to build, run, and integrate applications **locally** before containerizing them with tools like Docker.

## Why LocalOps?  

As someone transitioning from a non-tech background, I created LocalOps to master application workflows and bridge the gap between development and operations. This repository reflects my commitment to learning the fundamentals of pre-containerization practices while building a professional portfolio for DevOps and IT operations roles.

## Objectives  

1. **Learning and Practice**  
   - Understand the **code structure** of applications across various programming languages.  
   - Learn the **commands to run applications** locally and ensure they function as expected before containerization.  
   - Gain experience in **database integration**, including relational and non-relational systems like MySQL, PostgreSQL, and MongoDB.  

2. **Professional Portfolio**  
   - Showcase practical, real-world experience with multi-tier applications.  
   - Provide clear evidence of my skills and readiness to tackle DevOps workflows and IT operations challenges.
